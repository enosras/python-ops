EXPERIMENTS WITH DEVOPS FOR A SMALL CONTACT SHARING APP TO HELP WITH SMALL GROUP MATCHING

This is the structure for  an app that allows users to register for a small scale event, and after the event they can least their crush name, and in which case, if it mutual, they get to be matched.

It is an automated script, implemented as GUI. 

Additionally, it is my interest to expand this app to web and mobile platforms. the current prototype is striclty designed for desktops.
